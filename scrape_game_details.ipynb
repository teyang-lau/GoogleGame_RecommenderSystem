Edit: It gets a bit boring after a bit but its still fun enough so that I still play it.Ill give it a 3 or 4 star rating now.Also PAY 2 WIN!!!OOF!!!',\n  \"Game is great gameplay, graphics and missions wise. However, I hate their customer support. I bought a legend pass a week ago but it has not been activated for me yet. Also they seem to have deliberately made it difficult to find the customer support section. After searching for a while, I raised a ticket regarding the same but no reply from the support team ( it's been more than 5 days now). They don't even show the courtesy to let u know whether they are working on ur ticket.\",\n  'Well, it is fun. Though the people who pay money are getting a huge advantage compared to those who don\\'t, me included. I would say, instead of allowing the money spenders to have an advantage over the non spenders, maybe give all players the same things, except that the money payers get a head start. So for instance, the \"premium\" car hunts can be available for everyone, except that the money spenders are given more opportunities to earn blueprints or something like that.',\n  \"It really is the best looking and has the best gameplay/ controls. However .... Glitchy servers in multiplayer mode means the game crashes constantly! This wouldn't be so bad if it you didn't lose points when it does but you do! Also be prepared to grind it out for a long time if you don't want to spend real money on cars / upgrades. It definitely leans towards pay to win . Oh and there's lots of cheats! Silver cars in bronze league , gold cars in silver league and so on ..\",\n  \"It is been 2 years, I am playing. I have initially rated it to 5* considering the game play (graphic, control, routes, cars, competitions etc). The problem will start to come a year after once you catch up with most cars. You get nothing good with this game if you don't want to pay heavy. I understand that everything has a cost and players should contribute at some extent but their ask is unreasonable. They make it more unreasonable in each upgrade from all aspects for old players. GL fix it.\",\n  'This is my favourite game. Really good graphics. Wish u all bring the cars like totyta gtx, audi , ktm gt, nanoflow , drako , ruf ..... Really love this game and expecting more from u. And i wish there are more race track and music I also wish that all cars can be seen by us even if we have not yet obtained it. As soon as the perticular event finishes the cars disappeared. I hope that can be included.',\n  \"Ads became more aggressive now. They pop up even if I don't want to see them. Cars bought with money are more powerful than earned. Not to mention it takes forever to get a car by playing. There are some bugs with the auto-drive, crashes the car for no reason. Have to wait 3 hours to play with the only car in higher class just once, then wait again 3 hours. Police cars; unbelievably strong, too powerful. Multiplayer car dividation sucks, can't use your best car to climb rank. Asphlt 8 was better\",\n  \"Game keeps on crashing and force closes itself. Whenever you won the race with good lead and good rewards. The Game force closes many times frequently and all your good rewards earned were vanished in seconds . Though it's pay to win game, these type crashes makes this game more uncompetative & poor app development & immature way to make real gamers to go for pay for the in game packs that never ever happens. Suck it! Gameloft, even 20years of company. Useless ads & too much waiting for next.\",\n  \"Love the game but with the last update you ruined the graphics. At least on my phone the cars look different than before , they seem like they are flying on the asphalt without touching it , no more sparkling when you hit nitro , not the same feeling driving the cars. I don't know if it is just me or everything looks like a game from 10 years ago.\",\n  \"I like this game, but have some concerns. 1. Not an offline game 2. The graphics are fine, but ofter , I'd see the cars borders quite pixelated. 3. Recently, the game constants keeps crashing when I try to play the career mode. Pls check this out and fix it\",\n  'The new drive syndicate is great! This game may be pretty pay to win but you can compete it without spending a penny. The graphics and gameplay is next level. Great offers. I already bought the legend pass. Although the physics are a bit wonky and comical I would still 100% would recommend.',\n  \"Really really fun! While it does have some balance issues, the controls are great and it's honestly the best looking mobile game I've seen. Perfect for arcade racing fans; there's so much to do, great cars, and all ads are optional.\",\n  \"It's a great game and the gameplay is well made. I like the fact that you always have a chance to win the races. I understand that this is mobile game but the graphics could use a little spoofing. Over all it's a great game. You can watch a short video to get a good amount more of cash and it is really helpful.\",\n  \"Generally speaking, I enjoy this game. The racing's fun and there's a steady sense of progression. But, the game often crashes when I willingly watch ads for extra rewards, losing the reward and having to restart. This is unforgivable.\",\n  'I hope its not dissapoint everyone reading this but i got to tell u guys the real truth about this game. This game is getting worser every season , becoming more pay to win. The graphics are excellent but after playing more than one years i felt bored every day. They change the token system in weekly competition ,that not good. Last i would recommend not to play this pay to win game. I quit today',\n  \"It's pay to play. Take the Landslide level for example. It sets you up to fail from the start, I'm 150 points over recommendation, take short cuts, use purple/pink boost the entire level, and still come in second. Buy/get something else.\",\n  \"I still remember A9 was once fun back in 2018-early 2019, but now, just look at this game. I'm totally fine with paying something but this is way too much, no more old events to grab credits, bps or even tokens, reducing the ammount of rewards, even in Season Pass! Ultra aggresive AIs and adding sh*tty cops, I'm really done, GL, u'll never listen to us. Edit once more: one of the most terrible game company ever. Edit: wow, remove all MP rewards? God damn what a retard game company u are now....\",\n  \"New season, same mess. Reddish ghost cars racing backwards and forwards and always winning, popup from thin air, etc. Multiplayer is full of cheaters and worse than before. Gold, Siver and Bronze users racing in Silver league, etc. You win because of your ranking not because you're good or have the best car. Worst game ever. When will you fix the game problems and messy!?!?!? Don't waste your money. Game full of CHEATERS or whatever they're.\",\n  \"The game is fun and has good graphics.Progession without In app purchases is slow but still possible. The newly introduced seasons allow for mediocre rewards even without the paid legend pass. Sadly progression has slowed to a halt. I can't get any cars because they are impossible to afford with tokens. The current Drive syndicate event is terrible.Playing the same missions over and over doesn't even get you the new car. MP is horrible. rewards have been basically removed. Hopefully they change.\",\n  'Pay pay pay! Every menu item you tap will push you toward something you can buy with real cash. I get games have DLC, but you literally cannot do ANYTHING in A9 without being begged to spend actual money. Too pushy for sales, too many ads, and it seems GL has put gameplay on the back burner to focus on raking in the pennies. Utter, shameless greed at its finest.',\n  \"I love this game. I just wish that the company that controls this app would fix the reason why I have to shut it down so often. 50% of the time I have close all my recently opened apps and restart my phone to try to get it to work again. Most of the time even that doesn't work.\",\n  \"Great game but there are some downsides 1.A bit of lag and glitches 2.You have to play it 3 hours a day to unlock new cars but it's worth it. 3.The biggest downside is that it feels to me like a pay to win and even though this game has been so successful the ads are still poping up but I noticed a decrease in ads. Still I prefer it over many other games P.S THE GRAPHICS ARE EPIC!!\",\n  \"This game pushes you towards spending money. Because otherwise you don't get blueprint cards. Special Event races are getting biased day on day. Those users who don't have specific cars either let them free try the cars or let them play with other cars. The current way you cant play more than half of it. There is so much cheating going on in multiplayer as well as in other events which is not being checked.\",\n  \"After I made clear data to fix some lag occurred the last few days, I could not login to my Google account, thank you Gameloft, it blocked my account. I can't even log into my Facebook. I have bought two premium plus season. I missed the GP events after I get qualified.. Icontacted the support about the login issue, and they answered after three weeks with a stupid claims that my game installed from third party app. It's a horrible support. Such a waste of time and money on such a stupid game!\",\n  \"The Greatest Racing game of the Decade! Graphics are totally next level. Every minor things are specifically crafted. The Music blended with every scene creates marvelous experience. Don't feel guilty for purchasing items from the shop, cuz it's worth it.\",\n  'Only game in the world where you upgrade your car to make it slow, to loose the race, to make other cars or police car more aggressive. The game is design to not allow you to win. I bet no one can complete this game, even spending all your money. Most frustrating game ever. Not worth. Warning : do not install.',\n  \"It's an amazing game, the variety and visuals of each car are awesome. The tracks are beautifully made. One problem is that I keep disconnecting everytime I join a race. Please fix because I love this game.\",\n  \"Played car hunt everyday and only got les than 5 blueprints, they just fooling us! Season pass over priced for what we getting, real difference between someone who has it and someone who doesn't have - one car and gas for all cars; not worth it when considering what that one class B car can do for you. Not impressed at all! The game is enjoyable to beginners, when 80% complete with career races and above garage level 12 it becomes so boring üò¥ - nothing to play for.\",\n  \"DEC 11/ 2020 Update: Gained 2‚≠ê again. Update: Really happy with the new episodes and vehicles added:) more cash for ads options great too:) thanks for making it a choice:) Original Post: Fun game, great cars and plenty of racing options. I'd like to see more episodes added bc, along with the multi or contest races, the episodes help keep your points up when you really need to keep your club numbers up. Please add more episodes. Thx\",\n  \"This game is great as a former asphalt 8 player this is a great successor Pro: 1.this game's graphics are just amazing 2.gameplay/controls is really good(people complain about the lag in the game but that's mostly due the fact ur phone isn't good enough ) 3.career is great Con: 1. this game takes a lot of time to progress 2.

You should learn from call of duty it treats it's users good like giving everything easily and getting new content what you do is play this to get that and for that play another forthat play another\",\n  \"Don't know why Gameloft is ruining the game for free to play players. I mean okay , those who want the best cars from the beginning of the game they have to pay. I am completely fine with that. What's annoying is that the progress has changed from grindable to p2w. Nowadays there's no ads also for the ad pack so forget it. So I am stuck in the career , nowhere to go. You have to now play exhaustingly to find 2-3 blueprints for a car.

I had 5 gyms defended for 2 days and all came back to me at the same time. The first one reached the daily limit of 50. 50! It costs 100 just to get 20 pokeballs.

My daughter loves it as well, so its a win-win for me! :) But, I do wish that some different Pokemon would pop up every once in a while. Also, it takes way too long to level up. Needs to either be quicker to level up or a way for people to earn more XP.

I have to open the app 4 or 5 times to properly play the game without it saying 'try again later' for a few minutes at most.

There's upwards of 600 different Pok√©mon to catch (not to mention different versions of some, male and female forms, shiny versions and mega evolutions) so there are plenty of them to spend time walking around (or driving) to find. The best way to keep your Pok√©ball count up, is to keep your friend count maxed out (currently 200) and give out as many gifts as possible every single day. Oh!

Edit: I'm not sure if its just me but the Pok√©mon you catch and the ones the grunts have seem severely overpowered. I'm having trouble catching Pok√©mon with 0 stars and low CP even with a razz berry and ultra ball\",\n",

Makes it harder to play with friends who aren't too into the game. Would be great if we could have more friends online. Also would be great if we could shine our badges like in Diamond/Pearl. I recall this helped me take more ownership of them. So that would be cool. 4/5 until it is more accessible for everyone. True F2P for those that choose to earn stuff.\",\n",
       "  \"This game is just amazing. Catching Pok√©mon, battling against raid bosses or in PvP, everything is fun! Also, I love how the economy works, almost everything can be acquired without paying a single dollar (that means: no P2W!). Other remarkable aspect is that you get rewarded for a lot of things, so the experience is really good. I've never liked going for a walk or biking as much as while playing Pok√©mon GO.\",\n",

With my two sons and girlfriend all best friends on the game, there isn't a 5 star raid just the 4 of us can't take. I also love the remote raid passes.

I love the game I usually like walking or jogging trails and catching Pokemon But my problem is with the many many glitches that this app has It has made me lose matches online, losing raids, and I can't even sign in half the time. It has come to a point where they update the game and still haven't fixed the big ones. This game has brought me so much joy! But they really need someone else to handle the issues. Because Niantic isn't cutting it.\",\n",
       "  \"I love this series. I played the game summer 2016. Honestly one of the most fun times with it when it worked. Its a mostly stable experience now, although I do have a newer phone so that probably helps. My three biggest issues being, 1) lack of coins leading to lack of funds to purchase more bag and box space. Really hate that. 2/3) the game's audio quality and resolution used to be much higher then they are now. Prefer that because I'll play with headphones on. (Yes, I enjoy this games music.)\",\n",
       "  \"Generally good for getting outdoors, and interacting w people. During covid, the game makers have been pretty good about adapting game play for those stuck inside. I like that I can advance through this game pretty well without having to pay actual money. Before covid, one of my favorite things about this game is that it helps get you outside (walking eggs, raids, etc.). They've managed to keep it interesting throughout the years I've played, but sometimes too many events happen at once\",\n",
       "  \"Love the game, I realy enjoy the Pokemon franchise. Definitely worth five stars. HOWEVER,a few things lve noticed: I didn't get any shineys until I spent a good amount of money, which made me raise an eyebrow but could be acoincidence. I run out of pokeballs WAY too fast, making me spend money to get more. I do work at a mall though, so l can grab a few at work. But overall the game is fun and exactly what I've come to expect from Pokemon.\",\n",
       "  \"Great game but the reason I rate it so low as a 3 star is because, I can't log into my account anymore. I tried pressing forgot password and entered in my email and username and it said something about not having any information regarded my email so therefore I can't get my password back. It also said that i may of signed in using Google, which I did. Now I can't sign in using the sign in with google because it says, unable to authenticate. Niantic, fix your game please\",\n",
       "  \"Ridiculously low catch rates for useless pokemon like the stupid ice cream cone. You cant catch them with 20 pokeballs. I loved the game originally, but it's just a big money grab now. You cant gwt very far without spending actual money which I refuse to do. Most of the raid bosses are impossible unless you have at least 5 friends. Its really gone downhill\",\n",
       "  \"I've been playing since 2016, so a long time. It has its ups and downs, but it has always managed to pull me back in. Lately, I don't know. The game is super glitchy and it unevenly distributes certain items like revives meaning some people get a lot, some none. And either I'm a really bad player or the game is glitchier for me than others which makes me not want to play anymore. So, that is my latest review. The updates were coolish.\",\n",
       "  \"Bugs in game or sign-in issues. I've filled out dozens of reports in game but only had 2 problems. Everything is automated and if your problem isn't in the cookie cutter mold you're ignored. When you do get a person, they give copy and paste answers that doesn't even apply to the problem. Zero support!\",\n",
       "  \"At the moment, this game is too heavy on pay to play; it refuses to open half the time on the loading screen and is moving so fast, that niantic are struggling to fix any new bugs. Saying that, I really like pok√©mon and nothing is going to stop me playing, especially when I've already invested 4 years of my life playing the game. If it wasn't pok√©mon and something else like HP then I wouldn't support it.\",\n",
       "  \"The game as it is right now is a horrible buggy mess. The game randomly crashes or won't load to begin with. The worst part right now has to be the remote raiding system. Out of the probably 15 raids I have done remotely over the past week or so, I have had my game freeze on every single one, forcing me to reset the game and try to reenter the lobby before either the raid was finished, or in some cases I ran out of time and lost my pass. Save your money and avoid raiding until this is fixed.\",\n",
       "  \"I love the game, but it's been glitching lately. I'll use a remote raid pass and then it won't let my guy make any hits. I can't even back out of it, I have to completley close the game. When I try to go back into it, it makes me use another remote raid pass but still starts the raid like I never left and only a few seconds left. This has happened to me three times already!!!\",\n",
       "  \"Edit: Looks like they might have changed it back! Still a fun game, but they recently updated Adventure Sync so that it looks at your GPS data and not your step count. I'm pretty bummed that I can't walk on a treadmill anymore to hatch eggs during a pandemic. You would need to have your location on at all times and actually walk some distance. Other than that, it'd be 5 stars from me.\",\n",
       "  \"Pay to win... Lots of glitches. When you click on an incense once it doesn't work. Later a few days later I will click on an incense to see if it works. Once again nothing. Then when I click on the incense again later it uses 3 incense all at once on me. Don't bother complaining about anything ever. They refuse to do anything to fix or reimburse you for paid items lost. I could continue to go on with all the problems this game has.\",\n",

I usually stop and start months apart and see the improvements to it as time goes on. Perfect for playing when traveling as Pokemon seem to at least somewhat change based on where you are. And you can usually find people in your community to play the game with. I know there is at least one group who participates in raids frequently near me as a group for safety',\n",
       "  'This game use to be fun back then. Quick entertaining and filled your spare time. Now most of the time lagging, need to keep relaunch. Apart from that, nowadays more on money making scheme. My partner lost interest to it. Besides that, the progress for program now not worth it like mega revolution, just can be used up to 4 hours instead of permanent own after all the effort put by players.Developer should analyst players interest & loyalty towards to this game. From what I can see, getting bored',\n",
       "  \"This game is ok overall. The graphics are good so are the controls even though sometimes it doesn't count my steps and when throwing the poke ball it sometimes doesn't even launch in the direction you flung it in. The gameplay could definitely be better, the game is fun but gets boring rather quickly and eventually becomes pay to win since you run out of poke balls quick and to get more you need to pay real money for poke coins at a ridiculous price.\",\n",
       "  'I like the game, but it has become very unreliable, slows down, freezes, appears to concentrate more on unnecessary graphics and less on game playing. It has lost contact with it\\'s users and moved too far away from its basic concept. It would help if the \"you\\'re going too fast\" banner was replaced with a radio button showing current speed.',\n",
       "  \"To me, they've done everything right. They have adjusted the game to fit the pandemic. Everything they implement is to get people to GO OUT AND GET SOME FRESH AIR safely so they don't sit at home all day. Even when they remove bonuses, the game is fully playable in a safe environment. The only time it's not as playable is when under complete quarantine. People who complain about that probably aren't traveling anyway. Niantic and the Pok√©mon team are doing a great job.\",\n",
